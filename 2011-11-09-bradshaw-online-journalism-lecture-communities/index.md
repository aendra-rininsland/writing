+ Community management becoming more and more important
    + Makes sites:
        + sticky and engaged
    + Makes information collection:
        + distributed
    + Community content becomes:
        + editorially valuable
    + Things that impacted helpmeinvestigate:
        + The 1% of content creators have a very real effect on crowdsourcing
        + Modularity is important -- being able to break down tasks
        + Two types of crowdsourcing:
            + MechanicalTurk version
                + Guardian MPs expenses crowdsourcing project
                    + Not a lot of diversity in a population, just a lot of people
            + Investigative version
                + Ability to get specialists to work on projects
                + Visibility is key
+ Mistakes:
    + Don’t mistake Twitter/forums for a broadcast medium
    + “Field of dreams” approach
        + “Build it and they will come” doesn’t particularly work.
            + Don’t start with the technology; start with the people and the networks
	⁃	The “Post” process
	⁃	People
	⁃	Objectives
	⁃	“Get a good story” isn’t an objective the community will care about
	⁃	Strategy
	⁃	Often you won’t be managing a community, but are rather just a member needing to establish your own clout.
	⁃	Technology
	⁃	“Otherwise you’re walking around with a hammer and everything looks like a nail.”
	⁃	Remember copyright
	⁃	The “second visit problem”
	⁃	How do you get people to return?
	⁃	Problem of expansion and scalability
	⁃	Give people explicit tasks and project inputs
	⁃	Allow creation of groups
	⁃	“The Wikipedia Revolution”
	⁃	How Wikipedia dealt with the scaling problem
	⁃	Easy-to-use tools
	⁃	Don’t assume one tool will be the easiest for everyone.
	⁃	ToS, culture of site
	⁃	Newspapers experience difficulty because they start with big groups of people and can’t create a specific user culture
	⁃	Shirky -- communities need tools to defend themselves.
	⁃	Reward those who are helpful, hinder those who aren’t.
	⁃	Karma systems, etc.
