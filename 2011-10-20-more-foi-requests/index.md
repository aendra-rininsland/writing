### An FOI request is like a journey...
+ It's a many-step process, and while it might not go entirely smoothly, the more planning you do, the easier it'll be.
+ Research
    + Check it anyone else is already compiling data
        + Unions and other professional bodies, ombudsman, watchdog groups, researchers -- all useful
        + Disclosure logs first!
    + Try to find a context for your story
+ Making the request
    + Take screenshots; CC to self where applicable.
    + Request receipt
    + Remind of duty to advise and assist
    + Note differences between a service and an authority -- target your request appropriately!
