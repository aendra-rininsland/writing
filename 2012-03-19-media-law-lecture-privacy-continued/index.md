+ Section 39 -- Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Wide-ranging order allowing courts to grant order preventing identification of anyone 17 or under involved in court proceedings, either criminal or civil.
+ Section 11 order -- Allows court to withhold name of individual from public. I.e., in a blackmail case.
+ Common law and statutory qualified privilege -- two different types of defences:
	1. Defamation act (statutory) -- public forums fairly and accurately reported are protected under qualified privilege.
	2. Common law privilege -- derived from judge-made law. Reynolds Defence. A matter of public interest, which has been reported responsibly, can be defended as such.
+Article 2 -- Right to Life. If someone’s life is at stake due to reporting, injunction can be put up against identification
+ If an injunction is being sought against a matter that touches upon a matter relating to freedom of speech, newspaper must be contacted and judge shouldn’t granted unless it felt applicant is going to win.

### Industry regulations surrounding privacy

+ PCC Code / Ofcom Broadcasting Code
+ Provision that individual’s privacy should not be breached a very important part of codes.
+ Privacy should not be breached unless it’s in the public interest
	+ Not simply what’s interesting to the public.
	+ Focused on public health/safety; prevent public from being misled; protect national security; something the public should know about
+ Specific issues:
	+ Proportionality: is the breach that’s taking place proportionate to the wrongdoing being exposed?
		+ Secret filming: can’t be a fishing expedition; needs to have prima facie evidence.
	+ Public figures: politicians and others who have spent their life putting it into the public domain, less right than average person.
	+ Public domain: Similar to the above?
	+ Methodology: act respectfully and responsibly; put yourself in the position of who you’re filming.

+ Areas of privacy:
	+ People in distress
		+ Each individual case on its own merit; getting a sense of what’s going on is okay, but tight focus on person’s face is not.
	+ Intimate details
	+ Health matters
		+ Going into individual’s condition (esp. pregnancy before 12 weeks) on wrong side.
	+ Revisiting past events
	+ Children — heightened regulation to protect children, shouldn’t be questioned about private matters except in loco parentis 
	+ Door-stepping — Justified in on-the-day stories of public interest. Not normally for investigative reporting unless individual contacted beforehand and asked for a response. If response not given, might be justified to door-step. 
	+ Suicide — number of regulations to respect families and prevent copycats. Not allowed to be very in-depth. Photo of individual about to jump from bridge or window not allowed. 
		+ Daily Sport “suicide hotspots” story -- PCC ruled unacceptable, gave too much detail and encouraged copycats.
+ Locations
	+ Key test: “A reasonable expectation of privacy”
		+ Can be even in a public place
	+ Churches
		+ Paul McCartney praying after death of wife; Hallo in 1998. PCC ruled on McCartney’s side.
	+ Beaches
		+ Daily Mail article in 2000 about Anna Ford on public beach in swimwear.
		+ PCC ruled on side of news media; Ford appealed, ruling upheld.
		+ Anna Macpherson with children -- unacceptable (esp. because on private beach)
	+ An address of a celebrity
		+ Not acceptable to identify location of individual’s house.
			+ Daniel Craigg and Miz Dynamite made complaints; deemed to be on wrong side of the line.
	+ Funerals
		+ Carol Smiley at mother’s funeral — deemed unacceptable to film
	+ Filming with police
		+ No right to film in private house with police
		+ Filming arrest or police operation, would have to pixelate individuals arrested.
+ Methodology for gaining private information
	+ Filming in public places
		+ If visible to naked eye in a public place, it’s probably acceptable.
			+ Careful: shopping centres; royal parks; buses open to public but not public places.
	+ Long range lenses: care must be used.
		+ 2002 -- Julie Goodyear complained about photographs of her sitting in back garden via long lens. Considered breach, wouldn’t have been visible without lens and not in public interest.
	+ Secret filming
		+ Forms normally have to be filled out justifying filming.
	+ Harassment 
		+ Not allowed!
