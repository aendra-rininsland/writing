+ Who is a child?
    + 17 and below (in civil court and criminal court)
    + First interaction will be in the youth court.
    + Age 10 is age of mental capacity for committing a crime. Under 10s cannot be convicted of crimes.
+ The law: 10/17/18
    + Under 10s cannot be convicted.
    + Will be in youth court under 17.
    + Can be published about over 18.
+ Industry regulations:
    + Those at school
        + Those in school have a right to be left alone by the media.
    + Under 16
        + Can't interview about anything.
    + 16 and 17
        + Hard news -- care should be taken, parental permission sought before interview
        + Soft news, celebrity news, etc. -- probably less necessary.

### Children in the criminal courts
+ Prior to proceedings
    + Ofcom and PCC — care has to be taken if identifying child under 18.
+ Youth Court
    + §47 Children and Young Persons Act 1933
        + Public barred from proceedings, but journalists not.
        + No identification of any child involved with proceedings. Breeching is a criminal offense.
    + §49
    + When can be lifted
        + To avoid an injustice to the child
        + Child has been given an opportunity to contest the disclosure

### Crown Court
+ Serious cases will be transferred — i.e., murder
+ §39 Children and Young Persons Act 1933 -- discretionary order banning publication of name, address, school, etc.
    + Judges will ordinarily apply.
    + Identification doesn't mean just not naming — also means not giving sufficient detail so that not to identify that person.
+ Can be lifted
+ Children "concerned in the proceedings"
    + "Salt poisoning" case — child involved in the proceedings but not concerned.
    + Although child might be affected by the fact father/mother/etc. is involved, should not hinder open justice.
    + I.e., party to the proceedings — not merely related.
+ Those who turn 18
    + §39 automatically lifted when child turns 18.
+ Dead children
    + §39 can't be applied.
+ Young babies
    + Less reason to impose §39 than for someone who can read. 

### Children as victims of sexual offenses
+ Shouldn't be identified -- Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1966
+ Jigsaw identification — don't give sufficient details.
+ Never identify it as incest as that inherently points to a family member.
+ Adult may be identified so long as relationship between victim and defendant not identified.
     + "a serious sexual offense" used in place of "incest". 

### Industry regulations
+ Interviewing those under 16 — consent needed
+ At school — the right to be left alone
+ Children of celebrities
    + Should not be reported unless there's some justification other than the parent is famous or parent has taken child to, say, a premiere.
    + Murray v Big Pictures
+ Children as viewers
    + The watershed
    + Not glamorising drugs, crime
