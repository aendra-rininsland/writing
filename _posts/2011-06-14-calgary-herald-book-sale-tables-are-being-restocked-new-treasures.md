The wet weather on the weekend didn't deter book lovers from attending the 9th annual Calgary Book Drive and Sale.

"We actually had more people on Saturday than we did on Friday, which is kind of unusual for us," said book drive and sale co-ordinator Andria Brumwell. "Our attendance was definitely good; I think last Saturday and Sunday were maybe the best we've ever had."

Held in support of Calgary's Servants Anonymous Society and the Calgary Herald's Raise-a-Reader program, the event has so far raised more than $160,000 in its first weekend. The sale resumes Friday and concludes Sunday.

With new books being put out all the time -and whole trailers of unseen books ready for the sale this coming weekend -Brumwell said that those who've visited the sale will surely find something new, should they return.

According to book drive and sale volunteer co-ordinator Judy Baldwyn, the restocking process takes several hours on average.

"Volunteers normally start at 4 o'clock cleaning up and making sure the boxes are full," said Baldwyn. "It's pretty busy for about three to four hours.

"I think the book drive and sale has become almost a Calgary institution and people look forward to it every year," she said. "I mentor some students and they're quite excited about coming down here and finding books either for school or just to read over the summer."

For volunteer Calvin Lam, the best part about helping is learning new skills and meeting new people.

Lam said he looks forward to introducing younger relatives to comic characters he himself appreciates through items found at the sale.

"I saw comics from my generation that probably my younger cousin would really love to watch, like Calvin and Hobbes and Charlie Brown," said Lam.

The sale runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. this Friday to Sunday.
