To coincide with the release of a UN report on asylum seekers, I built two interactive maps showing change over previous year, both in terms of where asylum seekers were originating and where they were going. I also did a [writeup on the report](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/apr/05/asylum-seekers-mapped).
