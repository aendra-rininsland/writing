In my ongoing quest to make a non-Java-based ManyEyes clone, I have launched VizCloud, a Drupal distribution intended to allow simple dataset upload and visualization construction. I pretty much have the dataset parts down (Provided and maintained via SocialCalc through [Sheetnode](http://drupal.org/project/sheetnode), though I'm currently still developing the visualization aspect (Provided via d3.js â€” anyone with experience creating models in d3, please get back to me!).
