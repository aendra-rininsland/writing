Entrepreneurial Journalism — “Journalism in the age of disruption”

Disruption -- interruption of normal work and practices.
 + If it displaces an existing business or practice.
+ The economic mechanisms that have sustained quality journalism are in the process of being disrupted.
+ Effected by: scandals, increased transparency via groups like Wikileaks, and, mainly, slow innovation.
+ Disruption a painful process but offers opportunities for new businesses and rebirth.
+ Historical context:
	+ In the 18th century Britain moved from an agrarian to a machine-based economy via the industrial revolution
	+ Britain’s trade routes and technological industry positioned the country well.
+ Movement away from the era of mass production
+ Historic Fatality
	+ Agriculture -- is obviously beneficial. Once it caught on, it caught on quickly.
		+ Satisfied deep human desires for settlement and consistency
+ Division of power
	+ Gradual erosion of power for centralized sources.
	+ Gutenberg printing press disrupted the Catholic church’s control over the Christian faith.
+ Division of power has accelerated with the web
	+ Near universal access to information, which can be freely shared with others
	+ Cuts of middlemen
	+ Anyone an express themselves and find an audience.
+ As a result:
	+ Flattens hierarchical power structures
	+ Capital and information flows are faster, more fluid and chaotic
	+ Accelerating innovation
	+ Impulse is to both create and consume.
	+ Audience increasingly alienated by the mass market approach to media.
	+ Moore’s law specifies the speed of processors double every 18 months, but also that the cost of technology decreases, space and bandwidth increase.
+ Disruptive models
	+ Perrato Principle:
		+ 80% of your profit will come from 20% of your inventory
		+ Amazon undermined due to Toyatan retailing
			+ Make more from selling misfires than hits (The Long Tail)
	+ Music industry -- failed to innovate because of rival subscription-based services with incomplete inventories and format wars
		+ Apple rejected subscription model with iTunes by charging 99c per song, required individual songs to be sold instead of just whole albums
	+ Google particularly disruptive
		+ Google’s main service is search, which is made profitable by Adwords.
			+ Made newspaper advertising seem incredibly expensive and unreliable
	+ “Prisoner’s dilemma” -- Google takes away advertising revenue and commodifies news, but to remove stories from its service is to lose traffic to rivals.
	+ Value of information is near zero on Internet; key is to find value in other aspects of journalism
		+ Fact verification, sourcing, fact aggregation, etc.

Some innovators
+ Controlivest
	+ Portuguese company

+ Demand Media
	+ Looks for high traffic terms, builds articles relevant to search queries.
