### Questions from last week:
+ Section 39 order -- to surpress publication about details of a youth. Automatic ban in Youth Court.
+ PACE -- Police And Criminal Evidence Act; fundamental piece of legislation concerning police powers. How suspects, evidence, etc. should be approached, how police can require media organizations to disclose material to be used as evidence.
+ Redaction -- to remove parts of a document, whether for privacy, national security, etc.
+ Watershed -- the time during which it's assumed children no longer watch and more adult material can be shown. 9 pm and 5:30 am
+ Newton hearing -- a trial where a judge tries to ascertain which party is telling the truth.

### For next week:
+  What is a §4.2 order?
+  What is a §11 order?
+  What is a §46 order of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence?
+ What is the spy catcher principle?
+ Look at the definition of public interested in the PCC editor code and Ofcom Code of Practice

    + Must fairly and accurately report; viewed as a form of notation and with same contempt of court issues.
+ Open justice principle
    + Justice must be *seen* to be done, instead of simply being done.
+ R v.Felixstowe Justices (1987) -- decided press are the eyes of the public and needs to be present in court.

    + Even though reporting may case embarrassment to parties, is secondary to courts remaining open. Natural consequence to trial process.
