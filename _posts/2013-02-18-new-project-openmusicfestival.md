OpenMusicFestival is a Drupal distribution enabling music festivals of all sizes to create a rich, semantically-enabled website. Functionality includes extensive artist listings (Complete with Soundcloud and YouTube streams), schedules, venue listings — and because it's Drupal, more functionality like ticket sales and forums are only a module installation away.
