### Internships
+ "The more clear you are about what you're wanting to get out of an internship, the more likely it is you'll get something useful."
    + Portfolio pieces
        + Go for it, but don't be disappointed if not.
    + Contacts
    + Career navigation
    + Publication map
    + Skill tips
    + Specialist knowledge
         + Unlikely in 1-2 weeks
+ Each publication has a specific structure, and the more you can understand that, the better off you'll be and the more you'll learn
    + What is the power structure? Who decides things?
        + Who decides "when the talking stops" and what happens?
    + This can be difficult in newsrooms -- informal and formal power structures.
        + Formally the foreign editor should decide the coverage but in practice the editor might decide.
    + "Unleash your inner anthropologist."
        + Most newspapers can be divided into two categories, with sources of power in both:
            1. Input
                + How are resources allocated; what do readers want; who's going to do what?
            2. Output
                + Once that raw material has come in, what's important, what priority it's going to get, where it'll go, how it'll be changed, etc.
    + In a well-resourced and well-conducted media organization, not a single word would make it on page without going through the hands of at least 3 people.
        + Filter 1: section editor. Often no more than a glance.
        + Filter 2: night editor. Also a quick look: what a story is, what its projection possibilities are, etc.
        + Filter 3: sub editor. Trim to spec, put on page, etc.
        + Filter 4: revision editor. Review and make necessary changes
        + And on...
    + Learning who these people are and talking with them will improve your writing
    + Figure out the input side -- where are ideas decided, are there idea generation meetings, etc.? 
        + Make sure you have ideas ready for forward planning meetings.
             + Study the power structures before piping up — will your input be helpful/welcomed?
    + Find out where there's a need — usually a surplus of people wanting to write and a deficit of people wanting to make others look good (i.e., editing)
+ Find sympathetic people who will let you shadow them
    + Is there a good editor who will let you look over their shoulder while doing a massive cutting job? Sometimes simply studying somebody who excels at their job is more instructive than trying to get pieces into the paper. 
+ Go to conferences if possible
+ Don't disdain desks in out of the way places.
    + If you want to improve your writing, you'll get more practice and watch more editors if you go to a less prominent, less glamourous desk -- i.e., obituaries. 
+ Obvious but important: read the output of the place you're working at, and especially before you even get there

### CVs
+ Don't do more than 2 pages.
    + If you can't get your life in your early 20s in under 2 pages, you're not going to convince someone you're good at distilling information
+ Watch for spelling and grammar errors. Even the smallest errors will get your resume binned.
    + "It is never possible for a single individual to check their own work perfectly -- give it to somebody else."
         + "Carelessness has extremely high cost" -- your application is the first contact your organization will have with your writing.

### Cover letters
+ It's a courtesy; keep it brief
+ Briefly say what sets you apart
+ Mention why you want to work at that specific paper; establish your connection to that place.

### What employers look for:
+ Intellectual originality
+ Passion
+ Good degrees
+ Determination
+ Make the most of what's interesting about you
+ If you miss a graduate internship by a close distance, remember that most people who made it to the interview round still became successful journalists. 
+ Finally — remember these are organizations aiming for large audiences; don't overplay blogging.
    + Show you can write stories for several hundred thousand people, not nine people. Don't confuse writing for small, friendly audiences with spotting a story interesting to massive audiences.
