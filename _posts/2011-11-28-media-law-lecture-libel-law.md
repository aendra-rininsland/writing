+ “Anything that tends to lower the reputation of an individual amongst right thinking people or damages them in their trade or profession.”
+ Anything **negative** in a broad sense.
+ Examples:
    + Hypocrisy
    + Having an affair
    + Acting in an unprofessional manner
+ “At the heart of libel law is getting it right.”
    + Extreme requirement to be able to prove what you print.
+ Information has to be published to a third party to be libellous.
    + I.e., private emails not subject.
    + Substantial publication?
         + If published to a small group, less damaging
             + Jameel v. Dow Jones (2005)
                 + Wall Street Journal allegation was seen by 5 people.
                     + “It would be an abuse of process to commit so much of British law to such ... when so little is at stake.”
+ Burden of Proof
    + Claimant — that the article was published to a third party, claimant is reasonably identifiable and the article is defamatory
    + Defendant — that the statement was true.
+ Libel laws apply equally on the Internet as it does to other formats.
     + Are search engines considered publishers?
        + Metropolitan International Schools v. Design Technica, Google (2009)
            + Case thrown out because Google was a facilitator and not a publisher.
        + ISPs also exempt
    + Godfrey v. Demon Internet (1999)
        + Academic asked for defamatory article be taken down, Demon took 10 days to comply.
        + Demon Internet able to argue “innocent dissemination”
             + Same argument as a newsstand not knowing what’s in every periodical
             + However, one notice of defamation is given, then on the hook.
                 + Demon had to pay £15,000 in damages, but +£200,000 in legal
+ Limitation period — 1 year from publication date.
    + If on the Internet, however, publication continues until 1 year after article is taken down.
+ Since introduction of conditional fees, anyone can sue for libel
    + Lawyer can take on case and take fee from defendant, in addition to an “uplift” fee due to risk inherent in taking case on.
+ Repetition rule
    + If you’re repeating just what has been said elsewhere, you’re still on the hook.
    + Plus you can’t defend it since you have no evidence!
+ defamatory statements
    + Libel — published in a permanent form. Broadcasting considered libel.
    + Slander — Transitory statements
        + Victoria Beckham implied items in shop were fake and press reported it; successfully sued for £45,000 in losses. 
+ Injunctions are rare
    + Rule against prior restraint
        + If a publisher plans to prove a statement is true then should not be banned from publishing.
        + Law accepts in the law of libel that courts do not stop publication except in rare and exceptional circumstances. 
    + Bonnard v. Perryman
        + Bonnard established that "The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals should posses, and indeed, that they should exercise without
+ Damages
    + Special damages where you can prove actual loss, plus damages for loss of general reputation.

+ Individuals
    + Not the dead
    + Groups of individuals
        + Showing a photo of identifiable people at club attached to article on drug use could lead to this.
    + **Who is reasonably identifiable?**
+ Companies
+ Not public authorities/political parties
