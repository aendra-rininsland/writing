[n0tice](http://www.n0tice.com) is a hyperlocal, community-driven news, events and classifieds website brought to you by [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk). 

This plugin is designed to pull content from specific locales and/or n0ticeboards, allowing it to be curated for display on a WordPress blog.

A backend interface allows specific curations to be taken from n0tice, while a widget allows either curations or a raw feed to be displayed in a sidebar.

Plugin created in cooperation with the [Hackney Citizen](http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk).
