Use [Koding.com](http://www.koding.com)? Want to install Drupal — with Drush — really easily? Now you can, with my snazzy new Drupal Installer app. Just add it to your account's apps via GitHub and you'll have both a way to deploy Drupal in under 5 minutes, but also a control panel to manage your various sites. 

Free cloud-based Drupal website hosting? Yes, please!
