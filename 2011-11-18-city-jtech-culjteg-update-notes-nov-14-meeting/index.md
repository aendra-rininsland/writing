...Well, maybe next week we'll have a meeting at the scheduled time?

Due to Greenslade cancelling his Monday lecture, we bumped up our meeting time to then and had a general discussion. 

### Topics discussed (in no particular order):
+ Does Google Standout matter?
+ What does everyone think of iPad/iPhone-only publications like The Daily? 

### Project ideas discussed:
+ iPad/iPhone app

### New project champions!
+ Andrew Stuart: [@AndrewRStuart](http://twitter.com/aendrewrstuart)
+ Rebecca Ratcliffe [@r_ratclif](http://twitter.com/#!/r_ratclif)

 *(A project champion is a member who has stepped forward and said they'll both attend meetings and retweet information. Thanks to everyone who has volunteered!)*

# We're still mostly talking about what we want out of this group and various other logistical aspects. If you're interested, please join us next week at Saddlers on Monday at 5!
