+ Long-term trend towards rise of government and public sector research
    + Increased emphasis on evidence-based policymaking
        + consultation
        + policy options
        + evaluating results
    + Greater demand for user-focused services
        + scoping needs
        + customer experience
        + tracking satisfaction
        + segmenting customers
    + Greater need for efficiency savings
        + prioritisation
        + understanding "what works"
        + Public service reform/more for less
        + Co-production and behaviour change
    + Rising demands for accountability and transparency
+ Works across all areas of public policy
+ Only 0.16% of work is political polling for the media.
+ Public opinion poll: views of a representative sample of a defined population.
+ Polling measures perceptions rather than truth.
    + Perceptions determine public opinion — **not truth**.
    + Perceptions are also outcomes in their own right.
        + Our experiences of services determine perceptions of their quality.
    + Fear often has little relationship to risk
        + Fear of crime has gone up, but crime has ultimately gone down.
        + Worries about litter and environmental factors always rate highly; when addressed, overall worries about crime decrease.
+ Polls important, but need to be used appropriately.
    + How they're reported is also very important.
    + Only 2/3 of people can easily reduce 20% to 1/5 (I.e., percent to a fraction)
+ Four main poll types:
    + Peacetime polls (where we are now)
        + Snapshot indicator of how the public thinks it should vote at a given moment.
        + Polls don't predict what would happen; ask about a hypothetical election, answers are hypothetical too.
            + Better seen as a barometer -- doesn't predict the weather, measure something that is useful to know in predicting the weather. 
        + Regular Ipsos MORI opinion polls
            + Monthly political monitor
        + ICM, Yougov, GfK NOP, Populus, Comres, et al.
    + Campaign polls (during the campaign itself)
        + Measures what the public thinks it is going to do, but not a perfect predictor.
            + 14% of voters in 2010 said they made up their minds on whether/how they'll vote in the final 24 hours, another 9% in the last week.
        +  Interesting angle -- key marginal seats. Collaborated with Reuters.
        + The Ipsos MORI "Worm" -- how opinion changes during leaders' speeches.
    + Final poll (eve of election poll -- includes adjustments not applied to other polls; not "pure" polling
        + Exclude not registered to vote (5%)
        + Check postal voting (15%)
        + Further turnout adjustments:
            + Definitely decided or might change mind
            + How important is the result
            + How certain if raining
            + Whether sample has been contacted by campaigners
        + Plus: call-backs for late swing and imputed vote of refusers.
        + "Armchair" Labour voters -- say they'll vote Labour but don't turn out.
        + Was pretty close last election to outcome.
    + Exit poll (Who you voted for instead of how you'll vote)
        + Sit outside election booths and ask people.
        + Careful selection of polling stations
        + One person watches people leaving with a counter, send the other to select someone every n (10?) people.
        + Selected people are given a ballot, are asked to mark it. Results taken back and interpreted.
        + Tends to be polling stations since last time; look at "swing," or amount of change. Attempt to extrapolate to entire constituency and see whether enough swing to unseat incumbent.
        + Add up the sum of all swing to see how much change in system.
+ What makes a good poll?
    + Question wording is crucial.
        + Be relevant to respondent
        + Be easily understood
        + Unambiguous in meaning
        + Mean the same to client, researcher and all respondents
        + Relate to the survey objectives
        + Not be overly influenced by the context of the question
    + Having a good sample is crucial
        + Purely 'random' sampling no longer used — too difficult, expensive.
        + Well-conducted quota sampling produces weighted samples with a variance similar to random samples of the same size
        + Most people don't have strong views on a lot of things; you want their voice represented as well.
    + Reading and reporting the polls
        + However static public opinion actually is, the polls provide the media with a basis for giving the impression of flux, change and excitements. The more polls there are ... the more true this is.
        + However improbable a poll finding is, the media will publish of broadcast it. The more improbable a poll's finding is, the more likely the media will give it prominence.
        + Good questions to ask:
            + When were the fieldwork dates?
            + Was the sample representative
            + Is it a panel study, face-to-face, telephone or an online poll?
            + Are the questions unbiased?
            + Are differences statistically significant?
        + Watch the share, not the lead.
            + Shares should be within margin of error; it is this that will lead to variances in lead.
            + Differences will not be statistically significant.
        + Things to watch:
            + Generalising beyond the sample
            + Implying change when no trend has been measured
            + Emphasising the unimportant
            + Highlighting statistically insignificant findings
            + Quoting out of context
    + Curious and spurious: the Sweet FA Prediction Model
        + Weird correlation between the colours of the FA winner and the government taking power that year.
            + Data can be found that fits whatever prediction.
        + Polling isn't designed to predict the future.
