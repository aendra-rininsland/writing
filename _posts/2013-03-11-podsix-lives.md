After Minehost went belly-up, the communal Minecraft server I played on went dead —and stayed dead — for about 6 months. However, I have revived it, on brand spanking new hardway and several major iterations of Minecraft later! Not only that, but it's running the bad-assery that is Tekkit Lite, which means you can do crazy things like build automated mining robots, write simple computer programs **in-game**, harness the power of volcanoes, ***even create whole new dimensions via books like in Myst.***

Seriously, I have no idea why it took me so long to get on top of Tekkit. That shiz's cray. 

Because there's not much in terms of anti-griefing code on the server right now, it's invitation-only. Please contact me either via [email](http://aendrew.com/contact), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aendrew), Facebook, etc. if you want the address.
