## For exam
+ 30 multi-choice questions; 
+ Know the names and intent of provisions; know case names.

## Important cases
+ Flood v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (2011) -- Supreme Court
    + Upholds and restates the Reynolds Defence.
    + Article allegations that a British security company with wealthy Russian clients paid for sensitive information about extraditions
    + Subject to a libel complaint from police officer named. Flood was exonerated, so was pressing for libel.
    + Judges came down on side of the Times; argued it was in the public interest for story to be published.
    + "Story told was high public interest" -- argued if Flood were not named, other members of the extradition unit would come under public scrutiny. 

# Copyright Law
+ Purpose
    + Designed to ensure those who create copyright works — photographs, film footage, books, etc. — are rewarded for their labours.
    + Incentivizes creative work.
+ Tangible form
    + No copyright in ideas — has to be created before it gets copyright.
    + No copyright in facts
    + Hughie Green v. NZ Broadcasting (1989) — elements of original programming in a knockoff in New Zealand. "Nobody owns the rights to a talent contest."
    + Norowozian v. Arks (1999) — A Guinness advert using a technique ("jump cutting") and dance style was similar to that used in the plaintiff's film. Court ruled nobody owns a dance style or film technique.
+ Physical ownership v copyright
    + Approached as a property right (Specifically intellectual property)
    + If you receive a letter, copyright rests with the letter writer — not the receiver.
+ Copyrights in a news report
+ No need for a registration
    + You don't have to register work to have a copyright on something. No "copyright register". Work automatically gains protection, even without the ©
+ Breach — substantial use
    + "What is worth copying is worth protecting" — principle

## Who owns it?
+ Author -- if you're independent, then you own the copyright.
+ Employees -- if you're employed by someone, then it's your employer who owns the copyright.
+ Freelancers -- you generally own the copyright; newspapers now generally have a provision allowing reproduction of a piece bought from a freelancer online, etc.
    + Robin Ray v. Classic FM (1998) -- asked to create an internal system for classifying music work. Radio station then tried to sell system to others; court ruled Classic FM wasn't allowed to sell Ray's work without permission.
+ Assignment -- Who owns the copyright?
+ License -- What is the breadth of the license? Single use, only on TV, on the Internet, both? For a time length or Into perpetuity? Where is this usage allowed?

## Length of copyright
+ Creative works: 70 years from end of year author died
+ If author unknown, 70 years from end of year of publication
+ Sound recordings / broadcast: 50 years from end of year of first publication
     + If it involves, say, a song with lyrics, the lyrics will be copyrighted as per the above (I.e., 70 years).

## Legal events
+ §30 CopyrighT Designs and Patents Act 1988
    + "Fair dealing" provision places reporting current events about the interest of a copyright owner.
    + "Fair dealing with a work other than a photograph for the purpose of reporting events does not infringe any copyright in the work, so long as it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment."
+ What is fair?
    + Simply lifting content isn't fair; not giving a credit isn't fair.
    + Using material as wallpaper isn't fair.
    + Time Warner Co V. Channel Four Television (1994)
        + Over 80% of Clockwork Orange was shown in a programme on Channel 4; court ruled in favour of Channel 4 despite lack of permission.
    + Pro Seiben v. Carlton UK TV (1999)
        + Carlton UK TV was doing programme on chequebook journalism and used clip from Pro Seiben exclusive; ruled on side of Carlton.
+ Exclusivity
    + Less likely to be fair is just used to "yank rug out" from under a competitor. 
+ Motive
+ Informational
+ Restrictions
+ Credit
+ Does not apply to stills.
+ Fair dealing for criticism, review
+ Public interest defence?
    + Paddy Ashdown v. Telegraph — Telegraph had published snippet from plaintiff's unpublished autobiography; court ruled there was a public interest due to it soon coming out.
+ Damages — market rate/aggravated
    + Paid in terms of market rate; more in aggravated circumstances (photo stolen)
+ Release forms — important; allows you to use their footage forevermore. 
+ Sports footage — if showing footage, normally able to use 60 seconds with credit. If a series of matches (I.e., World Cup or something), increases to 90 seconds.
+ Internet — copyright applies as much as anywhere else. If using someone else's photo, you have to seek permission.
+ § 58 Copyright and Design Act
    + If someone giving a speech, you're generally allowed to report it without permission.
