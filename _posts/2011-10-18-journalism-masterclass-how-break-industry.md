Press Gazette editor Dominic Ponsford with...
## John Kay, chief reporter, The Sun
* Qualities:
    * Dogged determination
    * Ability to think on feet at lightning pace and tenacity
* Direct route -- graduate traineeship; must have 100 wpm shorthand. 180 reporters get whittled down to 4.
* Local newspaper route -- work at a small paper for awhile.
* News agency -- Southwestern Bristol; INS in Redding. Pays peanuts and has tonnes of work, but one gets experience.
* Or just get exclusive stories. Meet as many people as possible, talk to as many people as possible, make as many contacts as possible.
* Best part of job is getting to the office and having no idea what you're going to do that day.

## Karl Schneider, editorial development director, Reed Business Information (large B2B mag/web publisher)
* Qualities:
    * Rat-like determination
    * Passion for your topics
    * Willingness to share
* Opportunities to shape the profession have never been greater.
* 75% of revenue is from online -- unique to B2B.
* With B2B, it's very much about your community.
* If you're passionate about something, the chance to get paid for covering it is a fantastic privilege, and is possible usually *because* you're passionate about it.
    * If you're faking it, that generally comes across pretty quickly.
* Ways B2B makes money
    * Ads content
    * Paying users (over half)
    * Targeted advertising (possible due to the kinds of audience)
    * Online advertising
* Smart: using crowdsourcing to simultaneously gather data while using it to improve targeting. 
* Having to be willing to learn new things all the time; knowledge of HTML/CSS important
* The tools you need are free; this is a dramatic change.
    * If you come to a publisher saying you're passionate about telling stories and you're not doing it (via a blog, for instance), the publisher will question your honesty when all the tools are freely available.
* "If you want to get into journalism into any sector -- just go do it. You'll get attention."

## Chris Wimpress, political editor, Huffington Post UK
* "If you don't have a blog and are writing about stuff on your own time, then you should start doing it."
* You need to show tenacity; you might have absolutely no traffic for months, but keep at it.
* The Lobby -- group of journalists allowed to attend meetings with the PM's communications people.
    * "I really hope that anyone who's wanting to work in political journalism ... makes that process irrelevant."
* In response to criticism that HuffPo reduces the value of the written word, argues he'd rather many people earn less than 
* Apparently Guido Fawkes sells the IP addresses of people in gov for targeted advertising.
* Getting a job:
    * Don't listen to what anyone says about there not being jobs.
    * Show you have something different and interesting.
    * Intern recently hired was an English grad with a massive network of relevant contacts in the banking industry.
* It's really difficult to specialize if all you know how to do is be a journalist. Consider what kind of journalism you want to do and how you can start doing it.

##  Gaz Corfield, Editor of The West Londoner blog
* Got 3 million pageviews in that many days for blog
* Started a news WP blog about west London with FB and Twitter set up through Bit.ly
* Got a bunch of hits... Then the riots happened.
    * Got 1500 pageviews for initial riot coverage.
    * Started liveblogging and got a million page hits that day.
* Using Tweetdeck exclusively to cover; an update ever 90 seconds or so.
* Used location-based tweets to curate content.
* What separated from mainstream media was:
    1. First
    2. Fastest
    3. Everyone admitted they were first and fastest.
* Has started to get responses as a result.

### Q&A period

#### How to get work experience
* Schneider -- ask him or an editor
* Kay -- Murdoch scholarship
* Wimpress -- Do **NOT** write a "Dear Sir/Madame, ... I HAVE to do an internship, therefore I'm applying, here's my CV."

#### How to stand out?
* Use your initiative

#### What kind of blog should you have?
* Nobody really cares about personal blogs
* Show that you can drive traffic

#### Importance of journalism degrees?
* Immaterial; what's important is the core journalism skills.
* None of the panelists have one.

#### Getting into the Guardian/big papers
* Wimpress -- Just keep hammering away at the specific portion you're interested in.

#### Important of shorthand?
* Kay -- absolutely from an operational standpoint, though validity of shorthand notes is being questioned legally. Always have a tape backup.
* Wimpress -- Only has really needed it about 5 times, and those five times he *really* wished he had it.
* Schneider -- Ability to effectively and quickly tweet more important.

#### What if you're bad at telling stories?
* Kay -- Getting story more important than writing it. Gold standard is getting the story in the first place.
* Ponsford -- It's useless to have a room full of people who can write beautiful prose but nothing to write about.

#### Not sure what the last question was, but some points:
* Schneider -- Many ways to monetize stuff; just try some.
* Ponsford -- Having to report in the "ass end of nowhere" is really useful for learning story development skills
