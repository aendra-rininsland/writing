Over the last few months working with Drupal, I've wanted to become a more productive member of the community. To that end, I've been working on getting a full project approved in order to get "Git vetted" and thus be able to create full projects on Drupal.org.

[A bunch of work, six code reviews and a boatload of PAReview'ing later](http://drupal.org/node/1914740), I now have full project access and have started by creating GitHub Pages, which allows users to post copies of individual nodes to [GitHub's free HTML page hosting service](http://pages.github.com). This is a core bit of functionality for [VizCloud](http://vizcloud.org), intended to reduce server load on high-traffic nodes (For instance, a data visualization embedded in a news article).

Let me know if you like it or have any comments! I need to refine it a bunch still too â€” and absolutely love it when people submit patches in the issue queue.
