## A bit about Demotix...
+ Background is politics and freelancing
+ Desire to create not just a socially-responsible business, but a "actively good" one
+ Basic idea was to create a safe platform for anyone wanting to upload stories not being covered.
+ "Free speech as soft power" -- led to democratization of regions such as the Middle East.
+ "Mainstream media has been shedding jobs like a 70 year old man sheds hair."
    + Both foreign correspondents and local reporters are being cut.
    + Only 4 US newspapers even have a foreign desk.
    + Even the BBC doesn't have a full-time staffer in Latin America.
+ This enshrines "parachute journalism".
    + Shallow knowledge of local issue.
+ Ever-increasing reliance on AP and Reuters for world news. 
    + Ramifications for free speech.
+ Business model: instead of big networks of volunteers, Demotix receives content, sells it to newspapers and splits the take 50/50.
    + Launched in 2009; got scoops because of local journalists.
        + In June of that year, had several journalists in Iran when Ahmadinejad declared himself president after only one round of voting.
+ London-based sales team, global network of resellers, strategic partnership with Corbis

## "What we realized we couldn't do"
+ To build a model on citizen journalism, you have to get content that's sellable. 
    + Text is really difficult
         1. Most papers will tell you people can't write
         2. Impossible to copyright data; can't sell it as text.
+ Despite starting as a platform for free speech, platform is mainly used for photo and video.
+ Good at: bomb fallout, protests, Arab Spring, etc. 
+ Some contributors are able to live off earnings. Would be breaking even if weren't reinvesting at current pace.
+ People actually contributing journalistic content is a really small number.
+ "80/20 rule is actually 99/1 when it comes to useful content." -- Web 2.0 is a myth.
+ Very few people actually interested in newsgathering. 
+ Built network by a lot of reaching out to groups like local camera clubs.
+ "The way you go out and build your community in the beginning is how your community will be forever."
+ Example of Digg:
    + Used to be really cutting-edge stuff; lost their original users. Became free for all and lost its actual value.
    + Demotix, going for a specific demographic, has retained its user base.
        + One of its competitors (Citizen Site) sought to grow user base as much as possible and while they get the occasional good scoop, it's not as consistent.
            + That said, they're doing some interesting gamification stuff.
+ Gamification: "Web gurus treat human beings as children -- and are right to do so."
+ Temptation to use internal stats to gamify content filtering process, but feeling is it cheapens the process of journalism.
+ Worries about faked content. Happens to everyone and would be brutally bad if done early on. Use metadata and calling to verify.
+ Balance between speed and quality. 
    + Quality of photojournalism has vastly improved over the last decade or so, with everyone taking photos.
+ Storyful: "opposite of Demotix" in approach. Acts as breaking story news curation service.
    + Both pushes highly-shared stories to the front as well as verifies the content.
+ No way around using humans for news
+ Contributors everywhere except Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa
+ Important points for communities:
    + Improving that communities news
    + Learning how to engage that community is very important
         + Community is who will decide your front page. Off-site, will write your content.

## Questions to audience:
+ How has the relationship between journalist and audience changed?
    + Pew: "Views of the News Media 1985-2011"
    + Content quality has decreased
    + Culture of deference has lessened
    + Simultaneously adds new voices but decrease of trust in accuracy makes everything relative; what is true?
    + Liveblogging as a direct result of citizen journalism: "article without the stitching" due to the realization readers can "do the stitching themselves."
    + "Downside is we have nobody to trust."
+ How does a community impact the way in which you create news?
    + To drive engagement, repeat visits, etc.
    + Newspapers start from a negative position -- inaccurate, partisan and influenced. The community is those readers who have overcome that.
+ What is UGC good/bad at?
    + Good at: news sourcing, accuracy, trust, speed, data crunching, content
    + Bad at: access, investigative work, writing = "lowest common denominator journalism"
        + "You cannot do citizen journalism without a professional journalism lead."
            + The job of professional journalists now is to learn to manage these networks as effectively as possible.
    + Seymour Hersh at the New Yorker cannot be replaced by UGC -- he has relationships, time/funding, exceptionally difficult work, verification. Writes 10,000 word articles that are read. 
    + Hackgate is another example of something that couldn't be discovered by UGC.
+ What are the implications for journalism? Can UGC address some of the bigger blindspots in journalism? What is the next phase?
    + Shift in trust from professionalism to authenticity. 
        + "From Encyclopaedia Britannica to Wikipedia."
        + Things better managed as communities will become communities (i.e., Craigslist). Things that need unique curation and authority will continue to be run by journalists.
    + How do you sell truth?
        + Stories are now "collections of subjectivities."
