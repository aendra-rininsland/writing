## Robin Hamman, Director of Digital, Edelman (London)
Visiting Fellow of Journalism, City

+ If you ask general questions, the responses tend to be pretty low-quality.
+ While at BBC, they spent upwards of Â£1 mil on moderating just non-news content.
+ When you engage visitors, make sure you can at least acknowledge their contributions
     + Have editorial guidelines for user-submitted content up front.
+ Use tools like Yahoo! Pipes to glean snapshot of current posts on a topic and respond back to community directly.
+ Once you know what people are searching for, you can start to intelligently use keywords/tags/etc.
+ Most people (60%) need to hear something 3-5 times about a company to believe it is likely true -- Edelman Trust Barometer.
+ Seven behaviours of public engagement:
    + Listen with new intelligence
    + Participate in the conversation: real time / all the time
    + Socialise media relations
    + Create and co-create content
    + Champion open advocacy
    + Build active partnerships for the common good
    + Embrace the chaos
+ Embassies -- important as a transitory space between broader Internet and owned content; Google pagerank via natural language results.
+ 5 C's which deliver "lifetime value"
    + Content: value provided through quality content that educates, inspires, informs and connects community members.
    + Context: value provided by deep understanding of how participants within community want to engage and the tools they use to do so.
    + Connectivity: value provided by connecting members of community in mutually beneficial ways.
    + Continuity: value provided by sustaining efforts over time, ensuring that community is healthy and productive.
        + "Community isn't just for Christmas."
    + Collaboration: value established through collaborative efforts of participants who share, co-create and edit each others' efforts.
+ Five steps towards community engagement:
    1. Assess community needs and interest -- Radium6 ($$$$).
    2. Develop rules of engagement -- what do you do when you find a piece of content online?
        + Response considerations: transparency, sourcing, timeliness, tone, influence
    3. Identify right managers for your community
        + moderation = policing; hosting = building engagement
        + When a comment is removed, build accountability and followup -- *Why* was it removed? *Who* removed it?
        + Hosts provide environment, set agenda, welcome audience and then provide connections between audience members -- before backing off and manages everything else.
            + Metaphor of a party host
            + Connecting community to content and bringing out audience voice.
    4. Establish internal and external processes
        + Community management takes time; set expectations (When and who will be around?)
    5. Train, Equip and Deploy (TED)
        + Articulate -- able t communicate effectively in a variety of media
        + Social: engage in authentic conversation and interactions
        + Professional: act as a responsible ambassador of brand/org
        + Adaptable: can make decisions quickly, handle crisis situations
        + Enthusiastic: energetic, passionate and engaged in relevant topics
        + Connected: has ties to the right people within community
        + Organized: can keep track of data, relationships, content calendars and a variety of assets essential to maintaining community
+ Audiences *are* interested in your proceses
    + Cool idea: DJs using [Last.fm](http://last.fm)
        + Panorama using Delicious
+ The life cycle of content can be extended through social participation
    + Always reuse content and keep back catalogue as an asset.
+ Social media measurement:
    + Attention, engagement, authority, influence, sentiment
+ Examples of good social utilization:
    + American Expres OpenForum 
    + West Midlands Police; @wmp_helicopter; westmidlandspolice YouTube.
    + Spot.us -- really cool way of crowdsourcing journalism; content licensed as CC-attrib
    + Help Me Investigate
    + Ushahidi -- crowdsourcing, mapping crisis response (#radtacular)
    +  "Glamour Ask a Stylist" app -- take a photo and quickly get a response from a stylist. Can use incoming content for crowdsourcing article topics, targeting content, etc. etc. (#brilliant)
    + David Hone -- Shell climate change advisor; how to make activities more visible to internal staff.
         + Created blog, hooked it up to Delicious, Vimeo, Slideshare
    + GE -- curating voices of staff; marketing people don't have the technical insights product designers and whatnot will.
