This blog has admittedly been somewhat inactive the last, well, ever -- but especially so recently given I've been very much in the process of wrapping things up in Calgary before I move to London (England, not Ontario). If you check this site with any sense of frequency, apologies for how irregular updates have been, but suffice to say I'm redoing a lot of how I do web content such that it's much more streamlined in the future, and everything I ever write or post will end up here. As always, I'm also available on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/aendrew) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aendrew).
