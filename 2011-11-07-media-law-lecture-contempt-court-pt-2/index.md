#### Where in class?
Modules 1-3 are finished. First 14 chapters of textbook, plus human rights act, contempt of court act, PCC code of practice, Ofcom Broadcast code

### What type of information can lead to contempt proceedings?
+ Photographs of defendant when ID is an issue (Child abduction cases; identification parades; etc.)
    + Police press office will often make it known when identification is an issue.
    + Barrister will argue witness was predisposed by what was published; can dramatically mess up a case.
+ Previous convictions
+ Bad character
    + Attorney General v. Associated Newspapers LTD and News Group Newspapers Ltd (2011)
        + Even though only online, still contempt the court -- even despite jury being told not to go online and search for details.
            + Jury being told not to look for details applies specifically to jury going sleuthing, not all online news browsing.
+ Vilification of the defendant
    + Jeffries case re: Joanna Yates -- painted negative picture; resulted in libel damages *and* contempt prosecutions for Mirror Group and Sun. Would have discouraged witness to support Jeffries.
    + Between the bad character and Jeffries case, "Contempt is now alive and kicking as a course of law"
+ Detailed account of the evidence against the defendant
    + Talking about undisputed facts is okay, however, not giving detailed examinations of evidence against defendant
+ Details of confessions
    + At trial, the confession itself may be open to debate. Could prejudice jury if a newspaper details facts of confession in the meantime.
+ Comment on the evidence
    + Only what's said in court without giving judgement
+ Predictions on the verdict
+ Reconstructions
    + "Crimewatch" et al do reconstructions before arrests have been made, is okay.

### To avoid:
+ Comment on the evidence/credibility of witnesses
+ Adding extrinsic material/information/images that are not part of the evidence
+ Broad reconstructions of contested evidence
+ Predictions on witnesses/the outcome of the trial
+ Legal argument in absence of jury
     + Disclosable at end of trial but not while jury is in situ.
     + "Voir dire" legal argument during course of the trial.
+ Guilty pleas not known to the jury
    + Defendants might plea guilty in order to get lower sentence
+ Site visits showing jurors or identifying jurors.
    + Jury visited murder site in Joanna Yates case; identifying jurors through these is contempt

### What you *should* do:
+ Use stock phrases to make clear these are only allegations and not proven fact
+ Use quotes where possible

### Incidental risk
+ §5 Contempt of Court Act 1981
    + Discussion of matters of public interest in good faith where risk is incidental
+ Attorney General v. English (1983)
    + Daily Mail discussed pro-life candidate during case of doctor who had killed a Downs Syndrome child.
        + Just because a trial is taking place in relation to a certain subject doesn't mean discussion of that subject is completely shut down.

### Preliminary hearings
+ Magistrates Court §8 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 -- What *can* be reported
    + Name of court, magistrates, lawyers
    + Names/address defendant, witnesses
    + Decision whether to commit for trial
    + Whether Legal Aid granted
    + Whether reporting restrictions lifted
    + Arrangements as to bail, including conditions such as a condition of residence at a certain address but **not** reasons for refusal for bail — such as the defendant's previous convictions or likelihood of re-offending
    + Preliminary hearings in the Crown Court.

### Victims of sexual offences
+ Most victims gain automatic anonymity (absolute unless waived)
+ Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1976 and 1992
+ Must remain anonymous
    + What is anonymous?
        + Would they be recognized by own mother? If so, then not anonymous.
    + Jigsaw identification
        + Must be prevented; identification cannot be from random bits of info
    + Pixellation/voice distortion/background
+ Can be personal prosecuted
+ Waiving anonymity must be in writing
+ Takes place even after proceedings, **ad infinitum**, *and even post mortem.*

### Filming at court
+ Must be outside precincts of court
+ Cannot broadcast proceedings
    + Criminal Justice Act 1925
    + The Supreme Court
    + Plans by the Ministry of Justice to potentially allow filming in Appeals Court and Supreme Court (?) -- not finalized
+ Sketches
    + Cannot sketch in court
    + Must be from memory, outside of court
+ Tape recordings §9 Contempt of Court Act 1981
+ Tweeting in court: allowed if judge lets it (go through Clerk of the Court); normal contempt of court rules apply.
