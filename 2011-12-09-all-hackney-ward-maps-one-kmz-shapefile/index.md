As part of a project I'm working on for the [Hackney Citizen](http://hackneycitizen.co.uk), I'm creating a comprehensive map of a lot of different stuff going on in Hackney. One thing that would be particularly useful would be ward boundaries, ultimately comprising the area of the whole borough.

Much to my surprise, I could not find a single omnibus Hackney ward shapefile anywhere online. Thus I've created one, attached to this blog post.

<strike>Google Maps tops out at ~12 regions per page, so to get the entire borough you need to [download the full KMZ file](http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz) and load it into Google Earth. Going to the [full map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215653240665910605934.0004b39e926a519eded0c&msa=0&ll=51.546122,-0.060768&spn=0.068215,0.175438&iwloc=0004b39e94944f1f3f759) gives you pagination, though the effect is still kind of lost. (On that note: boo on Google Maps for not allowing you to set pagination specifics!)</strike> **EDIT:** Apparently supplying a link to a KMZ file in the Google Maps search field gives you all regions.

All boundaries courtesy of [mapit.mysociety.org](http://mapit.mysociety.org); all I really did was save each of their KML files and compile them together as a folder in Google Earth. Nothing too crazy-difficult, but hopefully should save somebody half an hour further down the road.
