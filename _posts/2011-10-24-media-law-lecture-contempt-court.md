#### Q's for next week:
+ What is jigsaw identification?
+ What are the rules on sketching court proceedings?
+ What is the CPS Media Protocol?
+ What does the law say about reporters speaking to jurors?
+ How many jurors in a criminal trial, what number is needed for a majority verdict?
    + 12; 11/12.

Media issue of the week: Lord Chief Justice laying out thoughts on the role of the media (full @ judiciary.gov.uk)
+ Principle of freedom of press not explicitly stated, but enshrined in various documents.
    + Free press is important; independent press can be reckless, but important for revealing public scandal.
    + "Crime is crime"; if a reporter commits a crime, it should be investigated.
    + Press Complaints Commission 20 years old; failure to exercise its powers indicative of an understanding of its position.
        + Comparable to a judge not passing the lengthiest sentence possible in a case.

Reading to date: terminology of first module, all the appendices, missed other stuff, need to ask somebody.

## Contempt of Court Act 1981
+ Purpose:
    + Avoid trial by media
    + Defendant's right to be tried on the evidence
+ Restricts reporting whilst sub judice
    + While proceedings are on, there are restrictions on what can be reported.
    + Protects jurors, defendant.
+ Open Justice
    + Justice should be seen to be done, as well as done.
    + Subject to scrutiny.
    + Doors of court are open to public.
    + Allows transparency.
    + Also part of the European Convention on Human Rights -- right to an public trial, though with qualifications.
+ Can information be controlled?
+ Article 6 and 10 European Convention on Human Rights
### The central contempt test
+ Proceedings active from arrest/issue of warrant for an arrest.
+ The test:
    + A publication which creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced.
+ Strict liability -- intent has little to do with it. 
+ Enforced by the attorney general.
    + Has to consent to a prosecution against a periodical.
+ Applies to a **risk** of prejudice, not actual prejudice.
    + Attorney General v. Express News
        + Daily Star published photos and names of footballers arrested in rape case despite Attorney General's request
             + No trial ever carried out, but Daily Star fined £60,000 for *risk* of prejudice.
+ Attorney General v. MGN Ltd. and News Group Newspapers LTD (2011)
    + Joana Yates case -- number of publications in Sun and Mirror that focused on Christopher Jeffries, Yates landlord.
         + Said landlord was peeping tom, has pedophile friend in jail, was obsessed by death, suggested had followed a woman contrary to wishes (immense vilification)
         + Both found in contempt of court; £18k and £50k fines. Could have prevented people from speaking up, jurors coming to court with an open mind.

### Sanctions:
    + Fines
    + Legal costs
    + Imprisonment
    + Wasted costs order: S93 Courts Act 2003
        + Third Party costs orders
        + "serious misconduct"
        + No need for contempt to be charged; attorney general does not have to give consent, judges can do it themselves.

### Prior to arrest
+ Common law contempt
    + Information serious prejudiced proceedings
    + Intention
    + Imminent
    + Rarely prosecuted
    + AG v. News Group Newspapers (1989)
        + Printed reports of doctor having raped 18 year old; Sun printed interviews with relatives stating they'd start a private prosecution.
            + Proceedings were imminent; real risk and intention of behalf of publication to muck up proceedings.
+ Libel -- even if contempt proceedings not brought.
    + Sexual offense victims have lifelong right to anonymity. Can be waived, but must be in writing.

### When are proceedings active?
+ Active from:
    + Arrest
    + Issue of warrant for arrest
+ Ends:
    + By acquittal or sentence
    + Discontinuance of proceedings
    + Staggered verdicts (i.e., multiple charges, defendants)
         + Proceedings are still active and continue until all verdicts reached

### Contempt: factors that may be relevant
+ The decision maker: jury or judge
    + After jury has made decision, the judge becomes the decision maker. Latter is less likely to be influenced by TV/media.
    + Laws under statute are primarily geared towards defending jury.
    + "red alert" any time there's a jury.
+ The impact on potential juror?
+ Each report looked at separately
+ What stage of proceedings?
    + The "Fade Factor"
        + Chance of contempt is much more likely when jury is in-situ as opposed to initial arrest.
        + Further away from trial, less likelihood for contempt.

### Examples of material may be in contempt
+ Photographs of defendant when ID is an issue
+ Previous convictions
+ Bad character
    + Attorney General v. Associated Newspapers LTD and News Group Newspapers Ltd. (2011)
+ Vilification of the defendant
+ Details account of the evidence against the defendant
+ Details of confessions
