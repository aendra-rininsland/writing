Just a quick City University London Journalism Technology Exploration Group (CULJTEG) update — last week was supposed to be our first meeting, however, we’ve postponed it until tomorrow, Tues. November 8, at 5:00 p.m. given everyone was super drained following the six-hour public administration fun-for-all that day. 

So, to reiterate: very first City J-Tech meeting Tues., Nov. 8 at 5:00 p.m., Saddlers Bar on campus. All are welcome to attend regardless of technical ability, concentration or programme— the only prerequisite is a desire to improve reporting through technology.

Tentative schedule:

1. Initial decisions: 
    + What should we call the group
    + What will we focus on?
    + Is Saddlers a good venue?
    + Who will champion this idea? 
        + I.e., who is willing to commit to promotion and being at every meeting?)
2. Open discussion
