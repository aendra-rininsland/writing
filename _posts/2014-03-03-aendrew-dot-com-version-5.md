It's been a long time in coming, but I've finally migrated from Drupal 7 to
the static HTML-generating powerhouse that is Octopress. This is admittedly
a bit of a departure from how I've previously done things — I've always been
quite the server-side nerd, starting when I learned PHP in tenth grade — but so
far I'm rather enjoying it. This marks the fifth iteration of the site, and I
hope that I can finally focus more on posting content than on keeping
Drupal modules updated.

Why the move?

Drupal is a nightmare to keep updated. While this is common amongst server-side
open source content management systems, Drupal's focus on small and modular
bits of functionality means keeping a site up-to-date with the latest contrib
code is somewhat of a challenge. And for a site I update maybe three or four
times a year, the likelihood of having out-of-date code online is rather high.

That'd be the main reason, beyond the fact I never really needed the raw power
that Drupal was able to provide. Yes, I tried making a "resume" content type
at one point, but it wasn't any easier to keep maintained than my LinkedIn
account or the public Google Doc I sent as a PDF when I was still looking for
work.

Additionally, I've started really enjoying the workflow provided by Git,
particularly when combiend with the finesse and joie de vivre of GitHub. Not
only can I host all my posts for free on GitHub pages, but I also have a great
way of going back through my work and visualising the changes I've made over
time. The hope is I can start publishing to my blog more regularly, as well as
using it as a place to workshop writing.

Admittedly the theme needs a bit more work, but it's nice to be back in
Bootstrap Country.

I still think aendrew.com itself will always be more of portfolio site while my
[Tumblog](http://aendrew.tumblr.com) will be more bloggy in content, but
with any luck I can find the right balance to make both worthwhile.

-Æ.
