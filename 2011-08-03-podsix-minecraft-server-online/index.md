A few friends and I have been spending an inordinate amount of time playing Minecraft on a server hosted by somebody I know. Given we're starting to get more than a few people logged on simultaneously (and because we have a few users now connecting from outside of Calgary â€” which will also be my case in a month or so, see next post.), a few of us felt it was important to upgrade the infrastructure to a [professionally-hosted collocated server](http://minehost.org). If you're interested in joining us, please see the new Minecraft site I've set up at [minecraft.hairysquid.net](http://minecraft.hairysquid.net).
