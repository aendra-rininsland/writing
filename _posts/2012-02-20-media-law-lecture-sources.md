# Protecting a Journalist’s Sources
+ Industry Codes

+ Main themes
	+ Domestic law v. Europe
		+ Not a lot of protection under §10; other interests put above those of journalists.
+ X v Morgan Grampian 1990
	+ Leaker gave documents to Morgan Grampian. House of Lords didn’t agree, fined Goodwin £5,000 for Contempt of Court when he wouldn’t give it up.
+ Goodwin v UK 1996
	+ Goodwin took to European Court of Human Rights. Came down on his side, argued the order was not appropriate and should not have order him to give up source.

+ The Law
	+ Art 10 European Convention on Human Rights
		+ Freedom of expression and freedom to impart information
	+ §10 Contempt of Court Act 1981
		+ No disclosure... “Unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure ***is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.***”

+ Prevention of crime
	+ Re: An Inquiry under the Company Securities Act 1985
		+ Journalist for Independent had info; Monopolies Commissioner requested source to pursue insider trading charges.

	+ Elton John v Express Newspapers (2000)
		+ Elton John wanted to know who had disclosed material from a bin in his room.
		+ Inquiry wasn’t necessary; could be identified outside the court. Sir Elton hadn’t taken the lengths outside the court.
	+ Ashworth Hospital v MGN Ltd (2002)
